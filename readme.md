Travelers collect inspiring photos, videos, and links but struggle to turn that scattered media into a coherent, bookable itinerary. Our app uses GenAI to auto-detect the POI, restaurant, piece of art, beach etc in any shared content, then instantly maps, schedules, and unlocks one-tap actions like ticket purchases or restaurant reservations - eliminating tedious manual planning
