        Extract all location names, landmarks, restaurants, cafes, and 
        attractions from this travel video transcript.  Do not add city, 
        state/province or country names as a seperate location.
        Try to get to the core location name and not just a description. 
        These locations will be used to geocode the locations. 
        So make sure to extract the core location name.

        For example, if the transcript says "Greenwich Meridian Line at the Royal Observatory", 
        the location name should just be "Royal Observatory".

        Also watch out for brand names and locations that might be duplicated. 

        For example, if the transcript says, "I love everything about the citizen M hotels especially their Tower of London hotel"
        the location name should just be "Citizen M Tower of London"

        Extract only the name of the location that this person seems to be visiting, 
        add any neighborhood or related landmark information to the main location name. 

        For example, if the transcript says, "I went to the shoreditch neighborhood to get to Dishoom"
        the location name should be "Dishoom Shoreditch"
