      "text": "This is day one of our weekend in London with Caledonian Sleeper. Now first of all, I love everything about the citizen M hotels and I loved them even more when we got to check into their Tower of London hotel straight away that morning after arriving on the sleeper. We dropped the bags and set off on a big sunshine stroll along the Thames, eyeing up all the iconic landmarks then meandering through the bustling and historic Borough Market where I picked up this amazing pistachio panache chocolate from Bread Ahead. After that, we had coffee from the back of a black taxi and a cheeky from the market at South Bank Centre. Then behaved like big kids on the merry go round before marching on through Central London to Chinatown and then to Coleman Garden. For dinner we hit Soho for Sri Lankan food at Hoppers. I just loved the compact interior, the dosa, the small plates, and this pineapple rum punch definitely packed a punch. The day finished with some soulful live tunes nearby at Ain't Nothing But the Blues bar and a nightcap back at the hotel in the ninth floor rooftop bar. What a day! Stay tuned for our second day in London and for the sleeper train journey back to Scotland."
